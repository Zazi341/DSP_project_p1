# DSP_project_p1
Part 1 of a 2-part Digital Signal Processing project, emphasizing the implementation of foundational operations in the frequency domain. This portion of the project, completed in collaboration with two fellow students, fulfills the objectives specified in the accompanying Task.pdf document.


# Summary:

Part 1 of the Digital Signal Processing project focuses on implementing foundational operations in the frequency domain. The task includes creating MATLAB routines for performing FFT and IFFT without using built-in functions, emphasizing both recursive and non-recursive implementations. The specific implementation type depends on the group parameters (e.g., the sum of ID digits). Validation of the implemented routines is done by comparing results with MATLAB's built-in functions. This section lays the groundwork for understanding and applying Fourier Transform concepts programmatically.

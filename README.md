# DSP_project_p1
Part 1 of a 2-part Digital Signal Processing project, focusing on implementing foundational operations in the frequency domain. This section, completed in collaboration with two fellow students, fulfills the objectives outlined in the accompanying Task.pdf document.

# Summary:
The project involves developing custom MATLAB routines to perform FFT and IFFT without relying on built-in functions. The implementation emphasizes both recursive and non-recursive approaches, with the specific method determined by group parameters (e.g., the sum of student ID digits). The accuracy of the developed routines is verified by comparing the results with MATLAB's built-in functions. This task provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying Fourier Transform techniques programmatically.
